                <li>
                  All Confidential Information shall be the property of the
                  disclosing party. Each Party agrees, and shall ensure that any
                  parent, subsidiary, affiliate, agent, consultant or otherwise
                  agrees: &#40;a&#41; to use the Confidential Information only
                  for the purposes of this Agreement and as expressly permitted
                  by this Agreement; &#40;b&#41; not to make copies of or store

                  of the other party or a third party&#41; as are contained in
                  or on the original or as the other party may otherwise
                  reasonably request; and &#40;d&#41; not to modify or prepare
                  derivative works from, or decompile, disassemble, or sell,
                  publish, make available, compile, display or transfer any
                  Confidential Information except as expressly permitted by this
                  Agreement.

                <li>
                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section will
                  prevent either Party from disclosing Confidential Information
                  of the other to the extent required by law, judicial order or
                  other legal obligations, provided that in such an event, the
                  Party disclosing such Confidential Information of the other
                  shall notify such Party to allow such Party to seek a
                  protective order or other appropriate relief. If a protective
                  order is not obtained, the Party required to make such
                  disclosure shall disclose only that portion of the
                  Confidential Information which its counsel advises is legally
                  required to disclose

                  Confidential Information of such Party which is in tangible
                  form, or certify in writing that all such Confidential
                  Information has been destroyed, except as allowed by Section
                  9.2 hereof.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Both Parties acknowledge that the disclosure of any
                  Confidential Information, except as expressly permitted by
                  this Agreement, will cause irreparable injury for which the
                  injured party may not have an adequate remedy at law.
                  Accordingly, either Party may seek injunctive relief against
                  the breach or threatened breach of any of the foregoing
                  undertakings in addition to any other legal remedies that may
                  be available, and each Party hereby consents to the obtaining
                  of such injunctive relief.
